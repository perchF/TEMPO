# Auto-DL 

### Introduction
Auto-DL helps you make Deep Learning models without writing a single line of code and giving as little input as possible.

- Using the GUI, you can specify the model components and [DLMML](https://github.com/Auto-DL/DLMML) will convert it to code, in the language and framework of your choice.

- You can input the task and other abstract inputs like “data directory”, and the model architecture will also be generated by Auto-DL. It will truly be a one-click DL model development.

### To run Auto DL

1. Clone the repo
